This guide explains both the "manual" way to complete each step in the pitch
angle measurement process, then points the user to the script that automates
that step.

----

.. note::

	Instructions have been tested only in Ubuntu and Mac.
	Instructions may need to be modified.

----

.. note::

	This guide was written for use with simulation data where galaxy images are
	already face-on, and currently includes no scripts for de-projecting images
	of inclined galaxies.

	Observational data in FITS images that have been deprojected will work as
	intended.

----

.. note::

	Code examples use brackets, ``< >``, to signify that you should insert your own
	file/directory names, etc.  Replace everything inside, including the
	brackets.

	For instance...

	.. code-block::

		function <input> <output>

	...would be replaced by something like...

	.. code-block::

		function my_input_file.csv my_output_file.txt

Background
##########

The tightness of arms in the disks of spiral galaxies (otherwise known as pitch
angle) can be measured using the `2DFFT <http://astro.host.ualr.edu/2DFFT/>`_
(2-Dimensional Fast Fourier Transform) package described in
`Davis et al. 2012 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJS..199...33D>`_.

Taking a large number of images through the pitch angle measurement process can
be very time-intensive, so we put together a number of (mostly) Python scripts
to automate as many of these tasks as possible.  We hope to make these utilities
(which currently exist as standalone scripts) into a cohesive package in the
near future.


.. _ps-to-fits:

(Optional) Converting images (PS to FITS)
#########################################

.. note::

	Please complete this step ONLY if you need to convert simulation output data
	from postcript to FITS.  Otherwise, skip to `Prepping Images for 2DFFT`_.

	These instructions have only been tested in Ubuntu.


Installation Notes
==================

If installing these for the first time, you should install
`Ghostscript <http://www.ghostscript.com/>`_ first, along with it's development
libraries, then build
`ImageMagick <http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php>`_ from source.

When configuring ImageMagick, link the Ghostscript libraries from the terminal:

.. code-block::

    ./configure --with-gslib=yes

This will allow ImageMagick to properly open up the .ps files.  If you get
errors about encoding/decoding (see the ImageMagick readme), this is most likely
a Ghostscript library linking problem, so make sure you have the newest/most
stable versions of ImageMagick/Ghostscript/corresponding developer libraries and
link them.


Manual Method
=============

The basic file conversion goes like:

.. code-block::

	convert <input filename> <output filename>

You must explicitly indicate the file format, either in the file name or with an
alternate form of the conversion command:

.. code-block::

	convert <input format>:<input filename> <output format>:<output filename>

Since the default file conversion from a colored .ps file to FITS will give you
a data cube (one image for each R,G & B channels), you want to convert the .ps
file to grayscale image or otherwise flatten the image:

.. code-block::

	convert -depth 8 input_file.ps -grayscale Rec709Luminance -resize 600x600 fits:output_file.ps

You can choose different grayscale settings, but all 6 or so produce images with
similar light intensity histograms.


Automated Method
================

Use script ``ps_to_fits.py``.  Modify the script to fit your file-naming
convention.

----

.. note::

	Script located at: ``2dfft_utils/misc/ps_to_fits.py``

----

.. note::

	You can also:

	* Convert all images to JPG, PNG or another "normal" image format for easy viewing later.
	* Stitch your images into a movie showing your simulation with ffmpeg.

	You may want rename your JPGs from the default ``frame.X.XXXGyr.`` prefix to
	something like 00.jpg, 01.jpg, etc.  Use Metamorphoses (available in
	Linux/Windows/Mac) if you prefer a GUI program for renaming files.


.. _prepping-images:

Prepping Images for 2DFFT
#########################

Prior to measuring spiral pitch angles with 2DFFT, the original galaxy image
must be modified in order to get the best measurement possible.  After
completing image manipulations, FITS files are converted into text files for
input into 2DFFT.

2DFFT assumes that:

* Input spirals will be "face on" (not inclined).
* Images are square, with the center of the spiral at the center of the image.
* There are no other structures present in the image (e.g., other galaxies, stars)

----

.. note::

	This guide does not contain instructions on how to de-project,
	star-subtract or isolate individual galaxies within an image, and therefore
	we offer no scripts to automate these tasks at the present.

----

Since this guide/package was originally written with isolated, simulated
galaxies in mind, we assume that you have "face-on", isolated galaxy images from
hereon out.

You will use IRAF/PyRAF to crop the image & to convert it to a text file.

You can use DS9 to look at the image, & find/confirm the center & radial extent
of the galaxy.

----

.. note::

	It's useful here to start a spreadsheet for every simulation with a column
	for each of the following snapshot attributes, which you will fill out as
	you go through the pitch angle measurement process:

	* Snapshot time

	* x & y coordinates of image center

	* Maximum radius of the image

	  * The radius of your cropped FITS file.

	* 90% of the maximum radius

	  * Pitch angles beyond this point are not reliable.

	* Bar radius (where applicable) or bulge radius (if non-circular)

	* Number of arms

	  * Visually confirm from image.

	* Dominant mode(s)

	  * From p max vs Radius & Pitch angle vs Radius plots; Visually confirm.

	* Inner radius 1

	  * The minimum radius of the selected stable region in Pitch angle vs Radius plot.

	* Inner radius 2

	  * The maximum radius of the selected stable region in Pitch angle vs Radius plot.

	* Average pitch angle

	  * From the selected stable region in Pitch angle vs Radius plot.

	* Standard deviation

	  * From the selected stable region in Pitch angle vs Radius plot.

	* 2DFFT error

	  * Due to limitations of 2DFFT.
	  * See `Davis et al. 2012 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJS..199...33D>`_)

	* Total error

	  * Standard deviation + 2DFFT error


Finding image center
====================

Manual Method
-------------

1. Start DS9, IRAF and cd from the IRAF terminal to the directory containing your FITS files.

2. Make initial guess of image center's x, y coordinates from visual inspection in DS9.

3. Find the image center in IRAF.

	.. code-block::

		imcntr frame.X.XXXGyr.fit [<your guess for x>] [<your guess for y>]

----

.. note::

	Use an odd number for the box size IRAF uses to sample the image, something
	bigger than the default of 5 (say, 31 for dimensions of a few hundred pixels
	on a side).

	To change this & other ``imcntr`` parameters, type: ``epar imcntr``.
	To quit the parameter editing mode, type: ``:q`` or ``:q!`` to exit without
	saving any changes (just as in Vim).

	See the `imcntr <http://iraf.net/irafhelp.php?val=proto.imcntr&help=Help+Page>`_
	page for more information.

----

4. Check results in DS9.

5. Round resulting coordinates to nearest whole number (since you can't crop by fractions of pixels) and record your result.


Automated Method
----------------

.. note::

	Script located in ``2dfft_utils/misc/get_center.py``.

----

1. Open up terminal and cd over to the directory containing your FITS files.

2. Put ``get_center.py`` in the same directory, and modify the script according to your file-naming scheme, guess for image center, etc.

3. Run the script.

	.. code-block::

		python get_center.py

4. The script will give you a file, ``all_centers.txt``, containing image names and IRAF's calculated center coordinates.  Use this output for the next step.


Finding galaxy radius
=====================

Manual Method
-------------

1. Open up your image in DS9.

2. Change the color scale to ``logarithmic``, ``histogram`` or something else that shows great contrast between pixels with values 0 and 1.

3. Click on the approximate image center.

  * You should see a circle appear.  You can change the color, shape, and other properties under `Region...`

4. Click inside the circle that appears

  * Four small squares should appear at each corner of the circle.  Click on one of those squares, and drag it until the circle encloses the disk structure.

5. Recenter and fine-tune the size of the circle to find the radius of the disk.

  * Click on `Region > Get Information...`, and edit the entry for the center using the coordinates you settled on using IRAF's ``imcntr``.
  * After resizing the circle, take note of the radius, rounding up or down to the nearest pixel, and add one pixel to this quantity if its even.

6. Record the final radius.

----

.. note::

	If you wish to use the output from this process to automate the next step
	(cropping) in Python/PyRAF (such as with ``auto_crop_fits.py``), save your
	radii as a list in a text file.


Automated Method
----------------

.. note::

	Script not yet in code base.

----

.. note::

	You can also automate this process using IRAF's ``ellipse``.


Cropping
========

Manual Method
-------------

1. Open up IRAF in terminal and cd to the directory containing your FITS files.

2. Using the center and radius you found earlier, crop your image.

	.. code-block::

		imcopy <input FITS>[<calculated low x>:<calculated high x>,<calculated low y>:<calculated high y>] <output FITS>

  Where:

  * low x = center x - radius
  * high x = center x + radius
  * low y = center y - radius
  * high y = center y + radius

3. You can check the final dimensions of the FITS image in DS9 by looking at the header information under `File > Display Fits Header...`
You can also use `Gimp <http://www.gimp.org/>`_ to look at FITS files.


Automated Method
----------------

.. note::

	Script located in ``2dfft_utils/misc/auto_crop_fits.py``.

----

1. Open up a terminal and cd over to the directory containing your FITS files.

2. Put ``auto_crop_fits.py`` in the same directory, and modify the script according to your file-naming scheme, etc.

3. Put ``all_centers.txt`` (a list of the center coordinates of all your directory's FITS files) and ``r_max.txt`` (a list of the radii of all your directory's FITS files) into your directory.  See previous steps, `Finding image center`_ and `Finding galaxy radius`_.

  Note that if you put these lists together manually, the order of the coordinates must match the order of the radii.

4. Run the script.

	.. code-block::

		python auto_crop_fits.py

5. The script will give you a cropped image, ``<original name>_crop.fits``, for each FITS file, ``<original name>.fits``, that it found and successfully cropped.

----

.. note::

	You can also automate this process using the `FITSIO <http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio/fitsio.html>`_ library.


Converting (FITS to text)
=========================

Manual Method
-------------

1. Open up IRAF in a terminal, and cd over to the directory containing your cropped FITS files.

2. Load up ``wtextimage`` (in the ``dataio`` package).  You have two options for using ``wtextimage``:

  a. Edit the parameter file once for all images and call the package as:

	.. code-block::

		wtext <input>.fits <output>.txt

  b. Edit the parameter file for every image, and call the package as:

	.. code-block::

		wtext

3. 	Once you've converted the image, open up the resulting text file and check to see if there is a blank row at the top.  If there is, delete it and save the file or set ``header=no`` in the parameter file and try converting again.

----

.. note::

	To edit the parameter file:

	.. code-block::

		epar wtext

	Edit the following lines:

	  input=	<LEAVE BLANK> OR <input>.fit

	  output= 	<LEAVE BLANK> OR <output>.txt

	  (header= 	no)

	  (pixels= 	yes)

	  (maxline= 10)

----

.. note::

	If you're having trouble editing with epar from the ``cl>``/``vocl>`` prompt
	(i.e., you're getting a lot of ``~``'s), do the following:

	* Use PyRAF, where an ``epar`` call brings up a GUI window for editing the parameters.

	OR

	1. Use the up/down arrow keys until the cursor rests on the line you want to edit.
	2. Use the ``Delete`` (NOT the ``Backspace``) button until the previous file name or preference has been completely overwritten by ``~``'s.
	3. Use the up/down arrows to leave the field, then go back and type in the new file name/preference.
	4. Repeat until all your fields are edited.  Type ``:q`` to save and quit, or ``:go`` to save and execute ``wtextimage``.


Automated Method
----------------

.. note::

	Script is located at ``2dfft_utils/fit2txt_all.cl``.

	Script will be updated to one in Python.


.. _running-2dfft:

Running 2DFFT
#############

.. note::

	Script located at: ``2dfft_utils/misc/list_for_scripter.py``.

----

To run 2DFFT, cd over to the directory containing the source code and copy your
FITS-turned-text file into the same directory.

----

.. note::

	It is recommended that you make a copy of the source code (in its own
	directory) for every set of images that you run through 2DFFT.

----

1. Create an input file for the executable ```Scripter`` to use.

  You have two options:

  a. You can use the template that comes with the code, ``input.txt``.  If you don't have a copy, it looks something like:


	<BLANK LINE>

	<image 1 name>.txt,<image 1 name>,<outer radius 1 in pixels>

	<image 2 name>.txt,<image 2 name>,<outer radius 2 in pixels>

	<image 2 name>.txt,<image 3 name>,<outer radius 3 in pixels>

	<BLANK LINE>

  b. You can use ``list_for_scripter.py`` to generate the file. Use ``r_max.txt``, (constructed in step, `Finding galaxy radius`_) as input.

2. Run ``Scripter``, giving it the input text file name and the output name you want for the final script.

3. Make the resulting script an executable(``chmod +x <script name>`` in Linux/Mac), and run it.

  When 2DFFT is done, you should get a series of files whose names end in ``_m1``, ``_m2``, .. ``_m6``.  There is one file for each of the six modes, so six 2DFFT data files per image.


.. _analyzing-2dfft-data:

Analyzing 2DFFT Data
####################

The mode files resulting from running 2DFFT contain pitch angle measurements
based on radius.

When 2DFFT "looks" for logarithmic spiral structure in an image, it does so
within the bounds of an annulus centered at the image/galaxy center.  This
annulus always has an inner radius of one pixel, and the outer radius must be
specified.  The six modes each represent an attempt to find a logarithmic spiral
of one arm, two arms, and so on.

``Scripter`` iterates over all possible annuli--the first annulus has a width of
one pixel, the second one a width of two pixels, and so on until it reaches the
maximum radius for the image.

To make sense of the 2DFFT data, it is necessary to determine which modes
dominate a given galaxy--its not always sufficient to base this on visual
inspection of the image.  Determining pitch angle is not trivial, either.  Real
and realistically-simulated galaxies are not perfectly logarithmic throughout
the disk, so pitch angle changes with radius.

To determine pitch angle for a given image, it becomes necessary to:

  1. Confirm dominant mode(s) in the data.
  2. Find ranges of radius in which pitch angle is relatively stable.
  3. Visually confirm pitch angle by overlaying galaxy image with logarithmic spirals.

At present, we assume that the user will pick pitch angle using only one mode.
For instance, if a galaxy contains 2 arms but has 2 small "spurs" as well, the
final pitch angle will look at mode 2 data.

Future versions of this package may also include the capability to average pitch
angle measurements from multiple modes in some meaningful way.


Plotting output
===============

.. note::

	Scripts are located at:

	  2dfft_utils/plots/2dfft_plots.py

	  2dfft_utils/plots/pitch_pmax_plot.py

----

``2dfft_utils`` currently has the capability to produce two different plot
types:

  * p max vs Radius

    * This indicates the relative dominance of the modes.

  * Pitch Angle versus Radius

    * This shows how pitch angle changes with radius for all modes.

To make these plots, you have two options:

  a. Import ``pitch_pmax_plot.py``'s functions within an interactive Python session.

    You can use this method to make plots for one image at a time.

  b. Run ``python 2dfft_plots.py`` outside of a Python session.

    You can use this method to make plots for individual images or in batches.  This will make both plot types.

We assume here that the user prefers the latter option.

1. cd to the directory containing all your 2DFFT data.  Put ``2dfft_plots.py`` and ``pitch_pmax_plot.py`` into this directory, and edit the scripts according to your file-naming scheme, etc.

2. Run ``2dfft_plots.py``, which will call ``pitch_pmax_plot.py`` to do the actual plotting.

	.. code-block::

		python 2dfft_plots.py

----

.. note::

	``2dfft_plots.py`` makes a list of all the unique basenames in the folder
	(e.g., ``my_galaxy_1``, ``my_galaxy_2``, etc., assuming that your data file
	names go like ``my_galaxy_1_m1``, ``my_galaxy_1_m2``, etc.).

	It calls ``pitch_pmax_plot.py`` to make `Pitch Angle vs Radius` and
	`p max vs Radius` plots that correspond to each of the original FITS images
	(``my_galaxy_1.fits``, ``my_galaxy_2.fits``, etc.) that you ran through
	2DFFT earlier.

	By default, you will get plots for ``m=1, 2..6``, but you can change this by
	editing ``pitch_pmax_plot.py``.  You can also choose to modify
	``2dfft_plots.py`` so that it calls only one plotting function.


Determining pitch angle
=======================

.. note::

	Scripts are located at:

	  2dfft_utils/analysis/slope_change.py
	  2dfft_utils/analysis/average_pitch.py
	  2dfft_utils/analysis/overlay-test_cmap-scales.py

----

To determine the pitch angle of a galaxy for a particular mode, you must choose
one or more stable regions from its `Pitch Angle vs Radius` plots, take the
average, then confirm the pitch angle by overlaying a logarithmic spiral arm on
top of the image of the galaxy.

----

.. note::

	Before you use the scripts for this section, its recommended that you get a
	feel for the process by doing a few pitch angle measurements "by hand".

	It is generally recommended that you avoid the outer 10% of a galaxy's
	radius, since pitch angles at that distance tend to be unreliable.
	Pitch angles taken from radii within bars or bulges will be very high and do
	not reflect pitch angles in the disk proper.

	For more details on the caveats of using 2DFFT and how to choose stable
	regions, see `Davis et al. 2012 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJS..199...33D>`_


Manual Method
-------------

1. Determine the number of arms.

  * Look at image and dominant mode(s) in `p max vs Radius` plot.
  * Note any irregularities (spurs, lack of symmetry, etc.)

2. Visually pick out stable regions(s) from `Pitch vs. Radius` plot.

  * Note the inner and outer radius of the stable region(s).
  * Compute the average pitch angle, standard deviation, and 2dfft error.

3. Visually check results and note uncertainties, e.g.,

  * Spiral arms that aren't truly logarithmic
  * Regions that give the wrong chirality (winding direction of the spiral; positive is clockwise winding).
  * Note high confidence, such as `Pitch vs Radius` plots where more than one mode agrees.


Automated Method
----------------

1. cd to the directory containing all your ``_m1``, ``_m2``, etc., files and place ``slope_change.py``, ``average_pitch.py`` and ``overlay-test_cmap-scales.py`` in the same folder.  Edit these scripts to reflect your file-naming scheme, etc.

2. Determine the number of arms.

  * Look at image and dominant mode(s) in `p max vs Radius` plot.
  * Note any irregularities (spurs, lack of symmetry, etc.).

3. Run ``slope_change.py`` for the modes selected.

	.. code-block::

		python slope_change.py

  You will be prompted for file names.

4. Compare ``slope_change.py``'s suggestions for stable regions to the `Pitch Angle vs Radius` plot and pick the best one.

  * ``slope_change.py`` will call ``average_pitch`` to calculate some quantities.

  * If more than one region gives good results, and those regions are separated by relatively small (~a few pixels) breaks due to noise, you can combine them.

5. Check your results with ``overlay-test_cmap-scales.py``.

	.. code-block::

		python overlay-test_cmap-scales.py

  You will be prompted for input.

  You can save the image by clicking on the ``Save`` button (shaped like a floppy disk) in the window that pops up.
